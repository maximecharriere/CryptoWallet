# CryptoWallet
It's often a mess to keep track of all your cryptos, if they are on several exchanges, in spot, saving, stacking, future wallets. Wallet managers like Coinstats are good, but sometimes they lack features that we would like to add with a few lines of code.  That's why this repo exists.
